***Project Overview***
This project is a Web App that will take a form input of a location name, and then 
redirect to another web page to show the name of the nearest MTBA station and whether
 this station is wheelchair accessible. In order to fulfill such function, I write a 
 mbta_helper function to automatically turn a place name into longtitude and latitude 
 and then use these information to obtain the station and whealchair information. Two 
 html template are used to take the input and return the output.
